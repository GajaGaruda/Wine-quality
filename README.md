 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning algorithms. The aim is to help wine producers and quality testers estimate wine quality efficiently using data-driven methods.



 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains various chemical attributes of red and white wine samples, along with a quality score ranging from 0 to 10.

Key Features:

* Fixed Acidity
* Volatile Acidity
* Citric Acid
* Residual Sugar
* Chlorides
* Free Sulfur Dioxide
* Total Sulfur Dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulphates
* Alcohol

Target Variable:

Quality:Integer score (0-10)

Dataset Source: [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)


 🎯 Objective

* Analyze the relationships between chemical properties and wine quality.
* Build a predictive model to classify wine quality based on input features.


 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
